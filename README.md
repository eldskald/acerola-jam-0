# Anger Issues

Game submission for the [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0) game jam. It's a platformer without a jump! The theme of the game jam was __aberration__, and I thought a platformer with no jump is an aberration in of itself. You can download the game on its [itch.io page](https://eldskald.itch.io/anger-issues).

It's a game about a very angry goblin chucking bombs and exploding everything, including himself!

It was built with Godot 4.2.1, so if you want to download and build a version exactly like these ones, just download it and export the project from the engine.
